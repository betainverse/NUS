sched2lists.py takes a sampling schedule such as the one generated by the tool at http://sbtools.uchc.edu/nmr/sample_scheduler/ or by the tool with mdd_nmr, and converts it into a set of delay lists and phase lists for non-uniform sampling. 
./sched2lists.py -s 8049.537 8002.838 -m 56 200 -n 2 -i Random_Poisson_56x200_30% -o KE_RP_56x200_30%

gives the following files: 
KE_RP_56x200_30%_delays  KE_RP_56x200_30%_plane1_delays  KE_RP_56x200_30%_plane1_sched   KE_RP_56x200_30%_plane2_phases
KE_RP_56x200_30%_phases  KE_RP_56x200_30%_plane1_phases  KE_RP_56x200_30%_plane2_delays  KE_RP_56x200_30%_plane2_sched
